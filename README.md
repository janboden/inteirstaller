Inteirstaller via Ansible
=========================

My iMac needed an update to 10.10, but just updating over the current version never seems a good idea. 
I was also tired of keeping to install everything everytime so I created **Inteirstaller**. 

**Inteirstaller** is a set of ansible configurations to setup *my personal development stack*.

#What does it do?

+ Install homebrew
+ Install Virtualbox - Vagrant

#how to use

- Install XCode
- Clone this
- Install ansible (sudo easy_install pip; sudo pip install ansible)
- Run it `ansible-playbook playbook.yml --ask-sudo-pass`

Feel free to check it out, try it, fork it, ...

*it's my first Ansible project, so be kind with the comments :-)*
